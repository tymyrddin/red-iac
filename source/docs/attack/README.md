# Introduction

## What?

The security of the tooling, the anonymity of the infrastructure, and how-to-stay-safe is becoming ever more important.

## Why?

* We will need stealth to not be detected by the blue team.
* And, for that matter, better protection from the ever-increasingly authoritarian world we seem to be forging for ourselves.

## How?

* [Choose carefully when using a VPN](vpn.md)
* [Pick a sound location to attack from](location.md)
* [Use an ephemeral OS](ephemeral.md)
* [Use an attack server](server.md)

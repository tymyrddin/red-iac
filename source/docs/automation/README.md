# Introduction

## What?

Infrastructure as code uses the idea of having a full declarative description of the components
that should be running at any given time, from the name of the machine to the last package
installed on it. A tool then parses this description file and corrects any discrepancies observed,
such as updating a firewall rule, changing an IP address, attaching more disk, or whatever is needed. 
If the resource disappears, itâ€™s brought back to life to match the desired state. 

Here we use AWS and Terraform.

## Why?

* Maintenance takes little time and we can focus on the red teaming itself.
* Automating the server set up process helps in exploring current DevOps methodology to better understand what to look 
for once we are in a similar environment.
* Terraform is open source and [supports a number of cloud providers](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers), 
which makes it the best choice if you chose an alternative provider that accepts Zcash.

## How?

* [AWS](aws.md)
* [Download Terraform in bouncing server](terraform.md)
* [Spawn containers](containers.md)

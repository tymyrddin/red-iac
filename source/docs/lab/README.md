# Introduction

## What?

Build a virtual local testlab.

## Why?

* Pentesting needs a lot of practice before you actually approach a client to do the same on their live system.
* It provides a simulated environment, your main system is not touched. If you break your operating system by mistake while experimenting with any hacking-related tools, it happens inside your virtual system. You can reinstall the damaged operating system again.
* We have to [stay within the law—always](purple:index). We must practice our hacking-related tools in a legal way on our own systems.
* You can safely browse any websites in a virtual environment. If some malicious code enters into your simulated environment, let it stay; it won’t touch your main system. You can do every type of testing on it.

## How?
